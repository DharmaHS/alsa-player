# alsa-player
A basic system audio player

Support folder playlist

Fast forward, slow down, pause, play, next track and previous track

just type in terminal
```
make
```
make sure you have gcc installed and have a make path established in windows, or just use linux, it just works (since most distros come with basic dependencies installed)
